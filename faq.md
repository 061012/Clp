**Q:** What is [CLP](http://www.github.com/coin-or/Clp/)?

**A:** (DN 08/27/04) The [COIN-OR](http://www.coin-or.org/) LP code is
designed to be a high quality Simplex code provided under the terms of
the [Eclipse Public License](http://www.opensource.org/licenses/eclipse-1.0.php). CLP is
written in C++, and is primarily intended to be used as a callable
library (though a rudimentary stand-alone executable exists). The first
release was version .90. The current release is version 1.00.2.

**Q:** What are some of the features of CLP?

**A:** (DN 08/27/04) CLP includes primal and dual Simplex solvers. Both
dual and primal algorithms can use matrix storage methods provided by
the user (0-1 and network matrices are already supported in addition to
the default sparse matrix). The dual algorithm has Dantzig and Steepest
edge row pivot choices; new ones may be provided by the user. The same
is true for the column pivot choice of the primal algorithm. The primal
can also use a non linear cost which should work for piecewise linear
convex functions. CLP also includes a barrier method for solving LPs.

**Q:** How do I obtain and install CLP?

**A:** (DN 08/27/04) Please see the [COIN-OR FAQ](http://www.coin-or.org/faqs.html) for details on how to
[obtain](http://www.coin-or.org/faqs.html#ObtainSrcCode) and
[install](http://www.coin-or.org/faqs.html#BuildCode) COIN-OR modules.

**Q:** Is CLP reliable?

**A:** (DN 09/07/04) CLP has been tested on many problems of up to 1.5
million constraints and has shown itself as reliable as OSL. It is also
being tested in the context of developing
[CBC](http://www.coin-or.org/faqs.html#CBC) ("Coin Branch and Cut",
which is used to solve integer programs); it is now considered reliable
enough to be at version 1.0.

**Q:** On which platforms does CLP run?

**A:** (DN 08/27/04) CLP compiles and has been tested (to varying
degrees) on the following platforms:

-   Linux using g++ version 3.1.1 (or later)

-   Windows using Microsoft Visual C++ 6

-   Windows using cygwin

-   AIX using xIC (not supported in the current Makefile)

**Q:** Is there any documentation for CLP?

**A:** (DN 09/16/04) An early release of a User Guide is available on
the [CLP user's guide page](https://coin-or.github.io/Clp). Also available
is a list of [CLP class descriptions](http://www.coin-or.org/Doxygen/Clp/) generated by
[Doxygen](http://www.doxygen.org).

**Q:** Is CLP as fast as OSL?

**A:** (DN 08/27/04) CLP uses sparse matrix techniques designed for very
large problems. The design criteria were for it not to be too slow. Some
speed has been sacrificed to make the code less opaque OSL (not
difficult!).

**Q:** When will version 1.0 of CLP be available?

**A:** (DN 08/27/04) Version 1.0 was released in time for the 2004
[INFORMS](http://www.informs.org) [Annual Meeting](http://www.informs.org/Conf/Denver2004/) (24-27 October, 2004).

**Q:** The barrier method sounds interesting, what are some of the
details?

**A:** (DN 08/30/04) The CLP barrier method solves convex QPs as well as
LPs. In general, a barrier method requires implementation of the
algorithm, as well as a fast Cholesky factorization. CLP provides the
algorithm, and is expected to have a reasonable factorization
implementation by the release of CLP version 1.0. However, the sparse
factorization requires a good ordering algorithm, which the user is
expected to provide (perhaps a better factorization code as well).

**Q:** Which Cholesky factorizations codes are supported by CLP's
barrier method?

**A:** (DN 09/16/04) The Cholesky interface is flexible enough so that a
variety of Cholesky ordering and factorization codes can be used.
Interfaces are provided to each of the following:

-   Anshul Gupta's WSSMP parallel enabled ordering and factorization
    code

-   Sivan Toledo's TAUCS parallel enabled factorization code (the
    package includes third party ordering codes)

-   University of Florida's Approximate Minimum Degree (AMD) ordering
    code (the CLP native factorization code is used with this ordering
    code)

-   CLP native code: very weak ordering but competitive nonparallel
    factorization

-   Fast dense factorization

**Q:** When will CLP have a good native ordering?

**A:** (DN 09/16/04) The best outcome would be to have an existing
ordering code available as part of the COIN distribution under the EPL.
However, if this is not possible, the native ordering will be made
respectable.

**Q:** Is the barrier code as mature as the simplex code?

**A:** (DN 09/16/04) The simplex code has been exposed to user testing
for more than a year and and the principal author, John Forrest, knows
more about simplex algorithms than interior point algorithms, so the
answer is "no". However, it performs well on test sets and seems to be
more reliable than some commercially available codes (including OSL).

**Q:** Which algorithm should I use for quadratic programming and should
I keep an eye open for any issues?

**A:** (DN 09/16/04) The interior point algorithm for quadratic
programming is much more elegant and normally much faster than the
quadratic simplex code. Caution is suggested with the presolve as not
all bugs have been found and squashed when a quadratic objective is
used. One may wish to switch off the crossover to a basic feasible
solution as the simplex code can be slow. The sequential linear code is
useful as a "crash" to the simplex code; its convergence is poor but,
say, 100 iterations could set up the problem well for the simplex code.

**Q:** What can the community do to help?

**A:** (DN 09/09/04) A lot! A good first step would be to join the CLP
[mailing lists](http://www.coin-or.org/mail.html). Some other
possibilities:

-   Comment on the design

-   Break the code, or better yet, mend it.

-   Add non-English language support in your own favo(u)rite language.

-   Improve the CLP executable. In particular it would be nice to be
    able to link the executable's online help system with the existing
    CLP Samples (e.g. entering `presol???` would give the user
    references to all CLP Sample files which use presolve).

-   Implement a dual Simplex method for QPs (quadratic programs)

-   Implement a parametric Simplex method

-   Implement a true network Simplex method (network matrix and
    factorization are already in place, but the method is not)

-   Fill the holes in the barrier method mentioned above.
